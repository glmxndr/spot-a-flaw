  <h3>Fellow Stoics,</h3>

<p>Welcome to the <em>Logical Fallacies Club</em> of the College of Stoic
Philosophers.  The purpose of this club is to continue the exploration
of Logical Thinking begun through the study of
S. Cannavo&#8217;s <em>Think to Win: The Power of Logic in Everyday
Life</em>.  Various items of public interest, news, etc are to be
offered to the club and examined for logical fallacies.  Various lists
of fallacies can be found on the internet in such places as:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/fallacies.html">Univ. North Carolina</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/659/03">Purdue University</a></li>

  <li><a href="http://leo.stcloudstate.edu/acadwrite/logic.html">St. Cloud State</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This is the maiden voyage of the Club, and I have been asked by
Erik Wiegardt, Scholarch of
the <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/thecollegeofstoicphilosophers/Home">College</a>,
to preside benevolently over the work of the Club in order to ensure
smooth sailing.  In this capacity I wish to offer <a href="topics/1">an initial excerpt</a>
from the contemporary news media.
The <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/yasmin-alibhai-brown/yasmin-alibhaibrown-licentiousness-breeds-extremism-1863919.html">following</a>
is an opinion piece by Yasmin Alibhai-Brown published in &#8220;The
Independent&#8221;, a UK based newspaper.</p>

<p>Please respond with one or more examples of a logical fallacy
exhibited by the piece, along with an explanation of why the argument
is fallacious.  Everyone is invited to comment on or critique the
entries that others make.  Please remember to remain civil in our
interactions with each other, and to offer and accept criticism
gracefully, as befits those undergoing the askesis of Stoic Wisdom.
Part of my role as President is to intervene if more heat than light
is being generated by a discussion.  For the most part I intend to
play a minimal supervising role.  We are all here to assist each
other, test our Stoic muscles, and support each other in the growth of
wisdom and virtue.</p>

<p>John B Brown</p>
